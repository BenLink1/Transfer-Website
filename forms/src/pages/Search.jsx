        Raddle is a lazy frog in the Animal Crossing series.
        He first appeared in Doubutsu no Mori e+ as an islander,
        after which he remained absent from the series until Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo, where he returns as a villager.
        His name is likely derived from a "rattling cough," a term for violent, hard coughing,
        which is related to his doctor-like appearance.

        In New Horizons, Raddle has the nature hobby and may be found reading a
        book pertaining to an item he is studying, which can be either flowers, bugs, fish, or fossils.
